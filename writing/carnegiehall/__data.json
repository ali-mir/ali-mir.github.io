I had never been before, despite the fact that Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious concert venues in the world and it’s only a nine minute walk from my office. A couple that lives in Emma’s building are part of a choir (as a hobby, I believe they have day-jobs), and they invited her. Tickets were $20, so we figured: why not? It’ll be a fun Monday night activity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side note: I always imagined that performing in Carnegie Hall was an impossible achievement reserved only for the very best musicians, but I was surprised to learn that almost anyone can book out a performance hall. It didn’t really diminish the grandeur for me, but I found this bit of info interesting (I also understood why we were able to get $20 dollar tickets).\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I went in without any expectations, as Emma bought the tickets and planned the evening, so I didn’t even know what we were going to be hearing! It ended up being the \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"https://dciny.org/events/a-soul-filled-journey-the-music-of-ola-gjeilo/\">music of Ola Gjeilo\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>, a Norwegian composer, and it was mostly choral music accompanied by the orchestra. I really liked the performance — the music resembled a fantasy soundtrack from something like \u003Cem>The\u003C/em> \u003Cem>Lord Of The Rings\u003C/em> or \u003Cem>The Elder Scrolls\u003C/em>, and I love that kind of nerdy stuff. I was in a weird dream-like state the entire time, but I attribute that to some slight sleep deprivation from a busy weekend combined with the historic ambiance of the venue. The performance was short: only an hour and a half or so.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>The point of all this is that I sometimes forget I have a ton of world-class arts and culture within my reach, just by virtue of living in New York City. It’s easy for me to get caught up in routines: trying to excel at work, maintaining meaningful friendships, staying active, sleeping well. This week’s performance was a gentle reminder to make sure I experience these wonderful things while I still can.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/carnegie.jpeg\" alt=\"performance hall\">\u003C/p>\n","carnegiehall"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
