<h2>January 7th, 2024</h2>
<p>Goodreads recently released their annual <em>Your Year in Books</em> review, and I read 23 books over the course of 2023! Ever since I started tracking my reading a few years ago, Iâ€™ve steadily increased the number of books I read each year:</p>
<p>2020: 7 books</p>
<p>2021: 14 books</p>
<p>2022: 18 books</p>
<p>2023: 23 books</p>
<p>I acknowledge that number of books read is a flawed metric (Iâ€™ve read some super short books and some really looong ones, and that doesnâ€™t even touch on content), but itâ€™s a good-enough indicator. Iâ€™m pretty happy with these numbers â€” I was an avid reader in grade school, but saw a severe drop-off during college. Back then my life was a whirlwind, and a rigorous course load and demanding social life left little time to read for pleasure. I would occasionally finish a book over winter or summer breaks, but otherwise I was an infrequent reader. These days Iâ€™m reading at home, on the subway, at cafes, while waiting for appointments, among other places. Iâ€™ve really enjoyed getting back into it!</p>
<p>Truthfully, this resurgence in my reading is all thanks to my Kindle. I acquired mine in 2020 on the recommendation of a good friend of mine, and now Iâ€™ll tell anyone thatâ€™ll listen: my Kindle has had such a profound effect on my reading habits that I encourage anyone and everyone to get one. </p>
<p>Due to its size and portability, Iâ€™m able to take it pretty much anywhere. During the summer, I can fit it snugly in my over-the-shoulder sling bag, and in the winter it essentially lives in my puffer jacket zip pocket. Itâ€™s light, thin, and pretty sturdy â€” Iâ€™ve tossed it around and it survives. As for books: the public library is your best friend. I was utterly astonished to learn how easy it is to read for free (at least in New York City). I didnâ€™t even need to go into a library branch to create an account! Iâ€™ll borrow two or three ebooks at a time, send them to my Kindle, and turn on Airplane Mode so the books can exist on my device past the library due date. It really feels magical.</p>
<p>A lot of people mention that theyâ€™re hesitant to purchase a Kindle because they prefer reading physical books. I understand the sentiment and had similar doubts but I found the transition to ebooks easy. I do love owning physical copies of my favorites, and so for any book I really loved Iâ€™ll purchase the paperback at my local bookstore. My shelf ends up being full of books I really love.</p>
<p>Some of this sounds like an ad, but Iâ€™m really thankful that Iâ€™ve rekindled my love for reading. Iâ€™ve read a plethora of genres the last few years â€” from non-fiction books on urban design and animal biology, to YA romance novels, to murder mysteries, to science fiction epics with detailed world-building spanning nine books. Iâ€™m excited to see how many books Iâ€™ll read in 2024!</p>
