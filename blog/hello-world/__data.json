I built this primarily to motivate myself to write more. Recently, I&#39;ve been feeling increasingly adrift on the internet, without a true online home (this elicits a whole separate blog post, and I hope to write it soon). I want a place to express my thoughts, one that I feel I have full control over. \u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I hope to write posts about a range of topics. Some technical, such as exploratory pieces on code, computers, and engineering, but also some that reflect my other interests â€” science fiction, modern political history, urban planning centered around people. Maybe I&#39;ll even write about mundane things in my day-to-day life. We&#39;ll see what I end up doing!\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Thank you for joining me. I appreciate you taking the time to read my rambling.\u003C/p>\n"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
