**[Stripe's monorepo developer environment](https://blog.nelhage.com/post/stripe-dev-environment/)**

I enjoy thinking (and complaining) about developer productivity, so it was fascinating to read this blog post by Nelson Elhage detailing Stripe's internal developer workflows (note: the infrastructure described in the blog is a few years old, and probably outdated by now). It's always cool to see how other companies build out their dev tooling, and I like to reflect on what we at MongoDB can do better about ours.

**[Why do CPUs have multiple cache levels?](https://fgiesen.wordpress.com/2016/08/07/why-do-cpus-have-multiple-cache-levels/)**

This was an interesting high-level dive into CPU caching, stuff I'm not super familiar with yet. I feel like there's so much to learn about in low-level computer systems, I'm worried I'll never have enough time!

I returned to Brown this past month for my five-year college reunion, and I fell in love with campus and Providence all over again. Coincidentally, I also just finished reading a Lovecraft novel, *At the Mountains of Madness* at the suggestion of a friend, and I had completely forgotten Lovecraft's ties to Providence!
