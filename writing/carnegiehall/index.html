<h2>April 30th, 2024</h2>
<p>This week, Emma and I went to go see a choral music performance at Carnegie Hall. I had never been before, despite the fact that Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious and honored concert venues in the world, and itâ€™s a mere nine minute walk from my office. A couple that lives in Emmaâ€™s building are part of a choir (as a hobby? I think they have day-jobs), and they invited her. Tickets were $20, so we thought: why not? Itâ€™ll be a fun Monday night activity.</p>
<p>Side note: I always imagined that performing in Carnegie Hall was an impossible achievement reserved only for the very best of the world, but I was surprised to learn that almost anyone can book out a performance hall. To get on stage there is undoubtedly an achievement, but I found this tidbit interesting.</p>
<p>I went in without any expectations, as Emma bought the tickets and planned the evening, so I didnâ€™t even know what we were going to be hearing! It ended up being the <strong><a href="https://dciny.org/events/a-soul-filled-journey-the-music-of-ola-gjeilo/">music of Ola Gjeilo</a></strong>, a Norwegian composer, and it was mostly choral music accompanied by the orchestra. I really liked the performance â€” I felt myself enter a dream-like state the entire time. Perhaps it was the historic ambiance of the venue, my slight sleep deprivation from a busy weekend, or â€”most likelyâ€” the music&#39;s resemblance to a fantasy film soundtrack (Iâ€™m looking at you, LOTR). I donâ€™t typically listen to a lot of choral music, but I excited Carnegie Hall feeling happy with the new experience.</p>
<p>Sometimes I forget that I have a plethora of world-class arts and culture within my reach, just by virtue of living in New York City. I get so caught up in the humdrum of life: trying to work hard, see friends, stay active, sleep well. This weekâ€™s performance was a gentle reminder to make sure I experience these wonderful things while I still can.</p>
