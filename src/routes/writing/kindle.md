# i love my kindle
## January 7th, 2024

Goodreads recently released their annual *Your Year in Books* review, and I read 23 books over the course of 2023! Ever since I started tracking my reading a few years ago, I’ve steadily increased the number of books I read each year:

2020: 7 books

2021: 14 books

2022: 18 books

2023: 23 books

I acknowledge that number of books read is a flawed metric (I’ve read some super short books and some really looong ones, and that doesn’t even touch on content), but it’s a good-enough indicator. I’m pretty happy with these numbers — I was an avid reader in grade school, but saw a severe drop-off during college. Back then my life was a whirlwind, and a rigorous course load and demanding social life left little time to read for pleasure. I would occasionally finish a book over winter or summer breaks, but otherwise I was an infrequent reader. These days I’m reading at home, on the subway, at cafes, while waiting for appointments, among other places. I’ve really enjoyed getting back into it!


Truthfully, this resurgence in my reading is all thanks to my Kindle. I acquired mine in 2020 on the recommendation of a good friend of mine, and now I’ll tell anyone that’ll listen: my Kindle has had such a profound effect on my reading habits that I encourage anyone and everyone to get one. 


Due to its size and portability, I’m able to take it pretty much anywhere. During the summer, I can fit it snugly in my over-the-shoulder sling bag, and in the winter it essentially lives in my puffer jacket zip pocket. It’s light, thin, and pretty sturdy — I’ve tossed it around and it survives. As for books: the public library is your best friend. I was utterly astonished to learn how easy it is to read for free (at least in New York City). I didn’t even need to go into a library branch to create an account! I’ll borrow two or three ebooks at a time, send them to my Kindle, and turn on Airplane Mode so the books can exist on my device past the library due date. It really feels magical.


A lot of people mention that they’re hesitant to purchase a Kindle because they prefer reading physical books. I understand the sentiment and had similar doubts but I found the transition to ebooks easy. I do love owning physical copies of my favorites, and so for any book I really loved I’ll purchase the paperback at my local bookstore. My shelf ends up being full of books I really love.


Some of this sounds like an ad, but I’m really thankful that I’ve rekindled my love for reading. I’ve read a plethora of genres the last few years — from non-fiction books on urban design and animal biology, to YA romance novels, to murder mysteries, to science fiction epics with detailed world-building spanning nine books. I’m excited to see how many books I’ll read in 2024!
