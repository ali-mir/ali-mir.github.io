# hello world!
## October 17, 2023

Welcome to my blog! I built this primarily to motivate myself to write more. Recently, I've been feeling increasingly adrift on the internet, without a true online home (this elicits a whole separate blog post, one that I hope to write soon). I want a place to express my thoughts, one that I feel I have full control over. 

I hope to write posts about a range of topics. Some technical, such as exploratory pieces on code, computers, and engineering, but also some that reflect my other interests â€” science fiction, modern political history, urban planning centered around people. Maybe I'll even write about mundane things in my day-to-day life. We'll see what I end up doing!

Thank you for joining me. I appreciate you taking the time to read my rambling.
