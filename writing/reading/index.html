Ever since I started tracking my reading a few years ago, I‚Äôve steadily increased the number of books I read each year:</p>
<p>2020: 7 books</p>
<p>2021: 14 books</p>
<p>2022: 18 books</p>
<p>2023: 23 books</p>
<p>I acknowledge that ‚Äúnumber of books read‚Äù is a flawed metric, but it‚Äôs good enough. I‚Äôm pretty happy with these numbers ‚Äî I was an avid reader growing up, but I saw a severe decline during college. Between classes and social life, being on campus kept me quite busy, and reading for pleasure fell on my list of priorities. I would occasionally finish a book or two over summer or winter breaks, but otherwise I was an infrequent reader. These days I‚Äôm reading everywhere: at home, on the subway, at cafes, while waiting for appointments, among other places. Truthfully, I was able to build back this habit almost entirely due to my Kindle. I bought mine in 2020 on the recommendation of a good friend, and I‚Äôve grown to love it. While I understand why many people prefer physical books over e-readers, the ease of instantly getting any book I want on the internet has made the Kindle experience more than worth giving up the tactile experience of a physical book. I‚Äôll purchase any book I really loved from my local bookstore, to keep my physical collection growing.</p>
<p>I mostly read a mix of fiction and non-fiction books, with my book choices in the former heavily skewing towards all types of science fiction. I fall on the sci-fi end of the sci-fi versus fantasy spectrum. As for non-fiction, I lean towards reading lots of historical non-fiction, focusing on time periods that fascinate me. These include 20th-century political history, the origins of computing, early human history, etc. I‚Äôll often throw in a a book about urbanism or science here or there.</p>
<p>I‚Äôm really excited to have been able to get back into it over the last couple of years! All my progress is on my Goodreads :)</p>
