I had never been before, despite the fact that Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious and honored concert venues in the world, and it’s a mere nine minute walk from my office. A couple that lives in Emma’s building are part of a choir (as a hobby? I think they have day-jobs), and they invited her. Tickets were $20, so we thought: why not? It’ll be a fun Monday night activity.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Side note: I always imagined that performing in Carnegie Hall was an impossible achievement reserved only for the very best of the world, but I was surprised to learn that almost anyone can book out a performance hall. To get on stage there is undoubtedly an achievement, but I found this tidbit interesting.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>I went in without any expectations, as Emma bought the tickets and planned the evening, so I didn’t even know what we were going to be hearing! It ended up being the \u003Cstrong>\u003Ca href=\"https://dciny.org/events/a-soul-filled-journey-the-music-of-ola-gjeilo/\">music of Ola Gjeilo\u003C/a>\u003C/strong>, a Norwegian composer, and it was mostly choral music accompanied by the orchestra. I really liked the performance — I felt myself enter a dream-like state the entire time. Perhaps it was the historic ambiance of the venue, my slight sleep deprivation from a busy weekend, or —most likely— the music&#39;s resemblance to a fantasy film soundtrack (I’m looking at you, LOTR). I don’t typically listen to a lot of choral music, but I excited Carnegie Hall feeling happy with the new experience.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>Sometimes, I forget that I have a plethora of world-class arts and culture within my reach, just by virtue of living in New York City. I get so caught up in the humdrum of life: trying to work hard, see friends, stay active, sleep well. This week’s performance was a gentle reminder to make sure I experience these wonderful things while I still can.\u003C/p>\n\u003Cp>\u003Cimg src=\"/carnegie.jpeg\" alt=\"performance hall\">\u003C/p>\n","carnegiehall"],"uses":{"params":["slug"]}}]}
