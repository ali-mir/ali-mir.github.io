<h2>January 7th, 2024</h2>
<p>Goodreads recently released their annual <em>Your Year in Books</em> review, and I read 23 books over the course of 2023! Ever since I started tracking my reading a few years ago, Iâ€™ve steadily increased the number of books I read each year:</p>
<p>2020: 7 books</p>
<p>2021: 14 books</p>
<p>2022: 18 books</p>
<p>2023: 23 books</p>
<p>I acknowledge that number of books read is a flawed metric (Iâ€™ve read some super short books and some really looong ones, and that doesnâ€™t even touch on content), but itâ€™s a good-enough indicator. Iâ€™m pretty happy with these numbers â€” I was an avid reader in grade school, but saw a severe drop-off during college. Back then my life was a whirlwind, and a rigorous course load and demanding social life left little time for much else. I would occasionally finish a book over winter or summer breaks, but otherwise I was an infrequent reader. These days Iâ€™m reading at home, on the subway, at cafes, while waiting for appointments, among other places.</p>
<p>Truthfully, most of this resurgence in my reading is due to my Kindle. I acquired mine in 2020 on the recommendation of a good friend of mine, and Iâ€™ve grown to love it. By checking out e-books from the New York Public Library Iâ€™m able to read almost anything for free, which makes me feel like I have the breadth of human knowledge at my fingertips.</p>
<p>As for genres, I read a mix of fiction and non-fiction books, with my book choices in the former heavily skewing towards all types of science fiction. I definitely fall on the sci-fi end of the sci-fi versus fantasy spectrum. As for non-fiction, I lean towards reading lots of historical non-fiction, focusing on time periods that fascinate me. These include 20th-century political history, the origins of computing, early human history, etc. Iâ€™ll often throw in a a book about urbanism or science here or there.</p>
<p>Iâ€™m really excited to have been able to build back the habit over the last couple of years. My only regret, as any voracious reader would say, is that I am captivated by so many topics I realistically wonâ€™t be able to read all the books I would like to over my lifetime. I can do my best, though.</p>
