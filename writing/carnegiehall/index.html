<h2>April 30th, 2024</h2>
<p>This week, Emma and I went to go see a choral music performance at Carnegie Hall. I had never been before, despite the fact that Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious concert venues in the world and itâ€™s only a nine minute walk from my office. A couple that lives in Emmaâ€™s building are part of a choir (as a hobby, I believe they have day-jobs), and they invited her. Tickets were $20, so we figured: why not? Itâ€™ll be a fun Monday night activity.</p>
<p>Side note: I always imagined that performing in Carnegie Hall was an impossible achievement reserved only for the very best musicians, but I was surprised to learn that almost anyone can book out a performance hall. It didnâ€™t really diminish the grandeur for me, but I found this bit of info interesting (I also understood why we were able to get $20 dollar tickets).</p>
<p>I went in without any expectations, as Emma bought the tickets and planned the evening, so I didnâ€™t even know what we were going to be hearing! It ended up being the <strong><a href="https://dciny.org/events/a-soul-filled-journey-the-music-of-ola-gjeilo/">music of Ola Gjeilo</a></strong>, a Norwegian composer, and it was mostly choral music accompanied by the orchestra. I really liked the performance â€” the music resembled a fantasy soundtrack from something like <em>The</em> <em>Lord Of The Rings</em> or <em>The Elder Scrolls</em>, and I love that kind of nerdy stuff. I was in a weird dream-like state the entire time, but I attribute that to some slight sleep deprivation from a busy weekend combined with the historic ambiance of the venue. The performance was short: only an hour and a half or so.</p>
<p>The point of all this is that I sometimes forget I have a ton of world-class arts and culture within my reach, just by virtue of living in New York City. Itâ€™s easy for me to get caught up in routines: trying to excel at work, maintaining meaningful friendships, staying active, sleeping well. This weekâ€™s performance was a gentle reminder to make sure I experience these wonderful things while I still can.</p>
