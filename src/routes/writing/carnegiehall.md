# carnegie hall
## April 30th, 2024

This week, Emma and I went to go see a choral music performance at Carnegie Hall. I had never been before, despite the fact that Carnegie Hall is one of the most prestigious concert venues in the world and it’s only a nine minute walk from my office. A couple that lives in Emma’s building are part of a choir and they invited her. Tickets were $20, so we figured: why not? It’ll be a fun Monday night activity.

Side note: I always imagined that performing in Carnegie Hall was an achievement reserved only for the very best musicians, but I was surprised to learn that almost anyone can book out a performance hall. It didn’t really diminish the grandeur of the event for me, but I found this bit of info interesting (I also then understood why we were able to get $20 dollar tickets).

I went in without any expectations (Emma bought the tickets and planned the evening), so I didn’t even know what we were going to be hearing. It ended up being the **[music of Ola Gjeilo](https://dciny.org/events/a-soul-filled-journey-the-music-of-ola-gjeilo/)**, a Norwegian composer, and it was mostly choral music accompanied by the orchestra. I really liked the performance — the music resembled a fantasy soundtrack from something like *The* *Lord Of The Rings* or *The Elder Scrolls*, and I love that kind of stuff.

I sometimes forget I have a ton of world-class arts and culture within my reach, just by virtue of living in New York City. On the subway ride home, I just thought about the fact that for a casual weekday activity, Emma and I went to one of the most reputable music venues in the world. It’s easy for me to get caught up in routines: trying to excel at work, maintaining meaningful friendships, staying active, sleeping well. This week’s performance was a gentle reminder to make sure I experience these wonderful things while I still can.
